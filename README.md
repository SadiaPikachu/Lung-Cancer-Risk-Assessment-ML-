# Lung Cancer Risk Assessment using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the risk of lung cancer using a machine learning model.  
A dataset containing patient information (such as age, smoking habits, and other health indicators) was used to train the model.  
The final system is deployed as a **Streamlit web app**, where users can input their details and get an estimated risk score.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a publicly available **Lung Cancer dataset** from Kaggle.  
It includes features such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Smoking history  
- Symptoms (coughing, chest pain, fatigue, etc.)  

Target label: **Lung Cancer Risk (Yes/No)**  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **scikit-learn** (for model training)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data preprocessing)
- **Joblib** (for saving/loading the model)
- **Streamlit** (for building the web interface)
